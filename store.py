# player enters store an is approached by the clerk.
# given three options, right now the two options that involve talking lead to the player having three options
# the player then can choose from directly asking for a disguise, which leads to requiring a hefty sum for it
# for the second option the player can beat around the bush asking for a disguise,
# which gives the clerk the impression you need some cosmetic help, leading him to take pity on you and offer the disguise kit for a discounted price
# the third option leads you to fight the clerk, an intense battle of fisticuffs!!! üí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèº
#
# if the player had decided not to talk, this enters ‚ú® SNEAKY TIME ‚ú®
# the player must keep an eye on the clerk's whereabouts and make decisions based on the clerk's position
# if the clerk is busy doing something, the player has the option of pocketing an item
# if the clerk is not cleaning or busy, he is at the register or wandering about, keeping a watchful eye on you.
# you have the options of waiting a certain amount of time to see if the clerk is still at the register,
# of if the clerk has moved on to cleaning or restocking the shelves.
# you can only pick up things when the clerk is busy.
# other wise he will spot you and throw you out of the store AND remove everything you took from your pockets ü§†
